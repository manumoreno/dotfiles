Work in progres...

## Neovim
* Using packer for plugin management. Will migrate to Lazy soon.
* While most lsps and plugins appear to be working fine they might need further tweaking (e.g. indent_blankline)
* Some plugin config files may not be in use. They are there because at some point I attempted to use them.
